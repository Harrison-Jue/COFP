# Sin Costan's Collection of Fun Projectiles

This is a repository full of codes and assets I have created for the game, Terraria using the modding API tModLoader.

All code was made with Notepadd++, may upgrade to Visual Studios for a more integrated environment. Most code here is
made without comments and then edited to include comments to explain what each part of the code does. Most textures (.PNG files)
were also created by me. This is an ongoing project of experimentation with the usage of projectiles within the game.
