# Sin Costan's Collection of Fun Projectiles

This is a repository full of codes and assets I have created as modifications for the game, Terraria using the modding API tModLoader.

All code was made with Notepadd++. Most code here is made without comments and then edited to include comments to explain what each part of the code does. Most textures (.PNG files) were also created by me using the MS Paint and then edited with the use of GIMP. This is no longer being worked on.
